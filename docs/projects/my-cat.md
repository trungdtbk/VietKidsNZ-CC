# My cat

### Your mission:
Using Scratch, build an app that you click on the cat character, it sounds :cat:. 
Can you also make it walks to the mouse-pointer as well? 
If you move the mouse-pointer around, the cat will follow :thumbup:

Try to do it yourself before looking at the instruction below.

??? "Click to see"

    1. **Create a new project, then you already have a cat**
    1. **Open the Block Palatte and look for this:** ![Start block](/images/scratch-start-block.png){: style="max-height:30px;width:auto;height:auto;"}
        
        ![Block Palatte](/images/scratch/palatte.png){: style="max-width:500px;width:auto;height:auto;"}

    1. **Build the following code: find the blocks, and drag them to the editor**

        ![](/images/my-cat/1.png){: style="max-width:500px;width:auto;height:auto;"}

        !!! info "How this works?"
            The **forever** block keeps everything inside it run forever. The **if** block says when two conditions: **mouse down?** (mean mouse click) and **touching mouse-pointer** (mean the mouse-pointer is over the cat) then do the things inside the block.

        Now test it! You should hear the cat sounds when clicking on it (of course, click Start first).

    1. **Now, make the cat move**:

        Add more blocks to your code to make it look like this:

        ![](/images/my-cat/2.png){: style="max-width:500px;width:auto;height:auto;"}

        !!! info "How this works?" 
            The **repeat until** block means do all the things inside top-to-bottom until the cat touches (reach) the mouse-pointer. Look inside, the block **next costume** tells the cat to switch between its costumes to make it like it is walking. 
        
        !!! warning "The wait block"
            **Watch out** for the **wait** block. It's very important. Try to remove it or change the wait value to see why.
            The **wait** block is commonly used inside a **repeat** or **forever** block.
        
        See its costumes here in the Costume tab:

        ![](/images/my-cat/3.png){: style="max-width:300px;width:auto;height:auto;"}
        ![](/images/my-cat/4.png){: style="max-width:300px;width:auto;height:auto;"}

    1. **Ok, we're done!**

        !!! question "Challenge"
            **Can you improve it by making a change or two, or adding something else?**
