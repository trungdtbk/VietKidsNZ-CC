# Myself intro

In this project, we're gonna talk about ourself... (Hey, do not say anything private like your real name and school, address, phone or email, ok?)

- First stuff, write a few sentences about yourself in your Scratch profile
- Next, build a Scratch program to introduce yourself to the world :). The basic thing may look like this.
