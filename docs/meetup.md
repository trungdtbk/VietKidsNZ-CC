# Our first meetup

Our first ever meetup will be on 16 Feb 2020. Bring along your laptop.

Since it is the first meetup, we'll do a bit of "tell me about yourself" :) and then setup Scratch accounts if you don't have yet. Then, we'll see how to use Scratch to write our first program.

You can take a look beforehand few materials about Scratch [here](/scratch). Also, you can borrow a lot of books about programming from local libraries. Some of the books are:

- Scratch Programming in easy steps
- Scratch programming playground: learn to program by making cool games
- Coding projects in Scratch
- Coding games in Scratch
- Computer coding with Scratch 3.0 workbook
- How Computers Work
