# [My cat :cat:](my-cat)

This is a simple Scratch app that does a few simple things. Can you do it?

**Difficulty**: Easy

* Create a project, name it **My cat** or whatever you like
* Make the cat sounds "meow" each time you click on it

That sounds easy, hah? How about:

* Make it go to the mouse pointer when you click somewhere else
* Make it like the cat is walking while it goes
