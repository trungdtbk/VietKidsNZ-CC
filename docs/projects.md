# Exploring Scratch

What you learn:

* What Scratch is
* Get familiar with Scratch user-interface (UI)
* See amazing things other Scratchers have built
* Have some funs, play a few games on Scratch
* Create your first Scratch project

# [My cat](/projects/my-cat)

This is a simple Scratch app that does a few simple things. Can you do it?

### Difficulty: Easy

* Create a project, name it **My cat** or whatever you like
* Make the cat sounds "meow" each time you click on it

That sounds easy, hah? How about:

* Make it go to the mouse pointer when you click somewhere else
* Make it like the cat is walking while it goes

Try to do it yourself. Then, **take a look [here](/projects/my-cat)** to see one way to do it.
