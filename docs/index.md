# Hey, welcome to VietKidsNZ Coding Club
* * *


Our plan for year is simple. First, we gonna learn Scratch together. When we find Scratch to be too childish, or we're too good at it we move on to build simple things with Roblox and Minecraft. By the end of the year, we may have a quick intro about making a website with HTML:). 

What the heck is HTML? Dunno yet, we'll find out.
